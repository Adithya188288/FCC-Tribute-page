            Swami Vivekananda, born Narendranath Datta, was an Indian Hindu
            monk, a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic
            Ramakrishna. He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian
            philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is
            credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the
            status of a major world religion during the late 19th century.

          <p>
            He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India, and
            contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India.
            Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna
            Mission. He is perhaps best known for his speech which began with
            the words - "Sisters and brothers of America ...," in which he
            introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions in
            Chicago in 1893.
